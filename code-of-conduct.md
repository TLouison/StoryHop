# StoryHop Code of Conduct
## Purpose
This code of conduct has been created in order to create a safe, encouraging 
environment for anyone who wishes to join the StoryHop community, this code 
of conduct will be enforced throughout the project.

## Overview
In any way shape or form, harassment is unacceptable within the StoryHop community.
One of the guiding principles of open source is non-discrimination, and as such,
we stand strongly against any language or actions (either in person or out), that
cause any member of our community to feel targeted or uncomfortable. Any violators 
of the policy will be warned by the core group. If there are repeat incidents, the
future of the violator within the project and community is up to the discretion of
the core group.

## Harassment Explained
In order to define harassment, we look to the description found on thoughtbot's
code of conduct. They state "Harassment includes offensive verbal comments 
related to gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate 
intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention."

Any individual that engages in behavior that can be categorized as harassment will
be expected to immediately cease the behavior following the warning given by the
core group.

If the warning is not heeded, we hold the right to remove the offending individual
from any codebase, communication channel, and comments, as well as escalating the
problem to GitHub support if the incident is beyond the scope of our project.

Any member who feels they are being harassed, targeted, bullied, or otherwise
discriminated against should communicate their concern through direct messages on
the official StoryHop discord, or contact one of the core group members through
GitHub. These members are: TLouison, geddir2, SimplySonder, ncwheeler700, and hertacalvo.

## Human Error
We acknowledge that humans are human, and mistakes get made! We want everyone in the
community to feel welcomed and as such, we are willing to work with people who make
honest mistakes. We like to work with people to resolve issues and learn from mistakes,
and will address cases as they need to be.
