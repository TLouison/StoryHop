## Description
  StoryHop is a one-word-at-a-time party game that can double as an educational tool. It is meant to be used within party settings, or for younger/non-native English speakers to practice forming novel and interesting sentences. Our goal for this semester is to create a minimum viable product that performs as we want, and hopefully an attractive user interface to entice users.
