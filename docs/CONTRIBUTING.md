# How to contribute

Story Hop is an open source party app and education tool developed by students
who always are welcoming to any help. We want to keep it as easy as possible to
contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few
guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of
keeping on top of things.
