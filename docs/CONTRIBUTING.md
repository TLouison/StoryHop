# How to contribute

Story Hop is an open source party app and education tool developed by students
who always are welcoming to any help. We want to keep it as easy as possible to
contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few
guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of
keeping on top of things.

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
* Make sure you have reviewed our [Style Guidlines](https://github.com/TLouison/StoryHop/blob/master/docs/Style_Guidelines.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TLouison/StoryHop/blob/master/docs/code-of-conduct.md)

## Making Changes
* Create a branch where you want to do your work
	* This should usually be branched from the master branch
* Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
* Make sure you comment your code well and add detailed commit messages
* Make sure you add and update tests for your changes

## Submitting Changes
* Push your changes to a topic branch
* Make sure to add good commit comments
* Submit a pull request for our core team to look at it during a future team meeting, and approve it if it meets our requirements.
