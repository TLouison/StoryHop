# StoryHop
StoryHop is a one-word-at-a-time party game that can double as an educational tool for people of all ages to improve
their understanding of the English language.

## Goals
Our goal with StoryHop is to improve the vocabulary, sentence structure, and intuitive sense of English syntax through
communicating with other English speakers. Along with this, we want to have the users develop a love of storytelling by
allowing their imaginations to guide the experience.

## The Team
The StoryHop core team consists of our five founding members. They are:
- Herta Calvo-Faugier
- Anthony Chen
- Robert Geddis-Hannon
- Todd Louison
- Nathaniel Wheeler
