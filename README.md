# StoryHop
StoryHop is a one-word-at-a-time party game that can double as an educational tool for people of all ages to improve
their understanding of the English language.

## About the Project
### Goals
Our goal with StoryHop is to improve the vocabulary, sentence structure, and intuitive sense of English syntax through
communicating with other English speakers. Along with this, we want to have the users develop a love of storytelling by
allowing their imaginations to guide the experience.

### Communication

### Reference Material
Our basis for our network infrastructure was based upon [lesterpig/openparty](https://github.com/Lesterpig/openparty). We have heavily modified
the code to the point where it no longer makes sense to be working as a fork of the project, but we recognize the contribution made by the
openparty project and thank lesterpig for his open source project.

StoryHop is being developed with an open source GPLv3 license.
