# StoryHop
A one-word-at-a-time party game that can double as an educational tool

## How to run
Once cloned, navigate to the `StoryHop` folder. From there, run the command
```node src/server/index.js```
Once run, the server will be attached to that terminal on port 3000, so simply connect to the sever in any web browser by typing `localhost:3000` into the address bar.
